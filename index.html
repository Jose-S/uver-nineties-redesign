         <p class="body-1">
            You can drive and earn as much as you want. And, the more you drive,
            the more you’ll make. Plus, you’ll get paid weekly and your fares get
            automatically deposited. Only drive when it works for you. There’s no
            office and no boss. That means you’ll always start and stop on your
            time—because with Uver, you’re in charge.

         think! Starting in 2023, Uber Air will enable shared, multimodal air transportation between suburbs, cities,
         and
         ultimately within cities. We’re working with our Elevate Network partners to launch fleets of small, electric
         VTOL (Vertical Take-off and Landing) in Dallas, Los Angeles, and a to-be-announced third international market.
