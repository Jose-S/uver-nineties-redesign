# uver-nineties-redesign
This website is a 90's redesign of the Uber's 2019 homepage. The art piece is part of a larger design project that attempts to imagine a world where 90's web design has endured. The project explores how early designers used this new medium, the web, to inform users. Moreover, it reminds us that the web is an ever evolving medium. The web design of today is yesterdays web design.
